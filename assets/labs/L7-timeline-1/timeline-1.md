## Setup and Recap

Last lab, we created a simple timeline with multiple trials. Let's pick up there. Create a new file called `experiment.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  
  <head>
    <title>My jsPsych experiment</title>
    <!-- import jsPsych -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.0.0"></script>

    <!-- import  the jsPsych styling file -->
    <link href="https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.3.1/css/jspsych.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    
    <!-- import some plugins -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-html-keyboard-response@1.0.0"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-instructions@1.0.0" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-image-keyboard-response@1.1.2"></script>
  </head>
  
  <body>

    <!-- jsPsych code goes here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">

      // initialize jsPsych
      var jsPsych = initJsPsych();

      // setup a timeline object 
      var timeline = [];

      // create a an instruction trial using the jsPsychInstructions plugin
      var instructionsTrial = {
        type: jsPsychInstructions,
        pages: [
          'Welcome to the experiment. Click next to begin.',
          'This is the second page of instructions.',
          'On each trial, you will be shown an image and asked to press one of two keys. Please click Continue to begin.'
        ],
        button_label_next: "Continue",
        button_label_previous: "Go Back",
        show_clickable_nav: true
      }
    
      var imageTrial = {
          type: jsPsychImageKeyboardResponse,
          stimulus: '290Q-DALL-E.png',
          stimulus_height: 200,
          choices: ['a', 'h'],
          prompt: "<p>Is this image generated by an AI model?<br>Press the 'a' key if you think it was generated by an AI model.<br>Press the 'h' key if you think it was created by a human.</p>",
      };
    
      // add both trials to the timeline
      timeline.push(instructionsTrial)
      timeline.push(imageTrial)

      // run the experiment
      jsPsych.run(timeline);

    </script>
  </body>

</html>
```

## Grouping and Repeating trials

In the code above, we have some instructions and then a single `jsPsychImageKeyboardResponse` trial. The simplest option for building a more complex timeline would be to add more trials to the timeline individually.

But often it may be useful to create groups of trials, and then re-use those groups of trials multiple times. For example, we may wish to present a fixation cross before presnting a stimulus briefly and then collecting a response. We might then want to repeat this trial structure multiple times. 

### Example: A simple training procedure
Here's one way we could achieve this kind of grouping and repeating using jsPsych.

First, let's create a fixation cross trial using the `jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse` plugin. The trial below displays a trivial HTML stimulus (`+`) for `500`ms, and does not allow participants to move forwards (`NO_KEYS`).

```js
var fixationCross = {
    type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,
    stimulus: '+',
    choices: "NO_KEYS",
    trial_duration: 500
}
```

Second, let's create a simple image presentation trial using the `jsPsychImageKeyboardResponse` plugin. This trial presents an image stimulus for `2.5` seconds. In order to run this trial, you will need to make sure the image refeerenced in the `stimulus` property is accessible on your computer (You can download `image-1.png` [here](https://github.com/ecl-ucb/290Q/tree/main/assets/labs/L7-timeline-1/page)). 

```js
var stimulusTrial = {
    type: jsPsychImageKeyboardResponse,
    stimulus: 'img-1.png',
    choices: "NO_KEYS",
    trial_duration: 2500
}
```

Finally, we can create a feedback trial using `jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse`.

```js
var feedbackTrial = {
	type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,
    stimulus: 'The correct response to this stimulus is: h<br><hr>Please press h to proced.',
    choices: ["h"],
    stimulus_width: 250,
}
```

We can group these trials togethor into a single object (`trainingProcedure`) that has it's own timeline, and can be repeated any number of times (by specifying the `repetitions` property of the object). Here's an example repeating the trial structure three times:

```js
var trainingProcedure = {
	timeline: [fixationCross, stimulusTrial, feedbackTrial],
	repetitions: 3
}
```

Let's add these trials into our HTML page, replacing the image trial from before. Our page as a whole should look someething like this now:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  
  <head>
    <title>My jsPsych experiment</title>
    <!-- import jsPsych -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.0.0"></script>

    <!-- import  the jsPsych styling file -->
    <link href="https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.3.1/css/jspsych.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
    
    <!-- import some plugins -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-html-keyboard-response@1.0.0"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-instructions@1.0.0" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-image-keyboard-response@1.1.2"></script>
  </head>
  
  <body>

    <!-- jsPsych code goes here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">

      // initialize jsPsych
      var jsPsych = initJsPsych();

      // setup a timeline object 
      var timeline = [];

      // create a an instruction trial using the jsPsychInstructions plugin
      var instructionsTrial = {
        type: jsPsychInstructions,
        pages: [
          'Welcome to the experiment. Click next to begin.',
          'This is the second page of instructions.',
          'On each trial, you will be shown an image and asked to press one of two keys. Please click Continue to begin.'
        ],
        button_label_next: "Continue",
        button_label_previous: "Go Back",
        show_clickable_nav: true
      }
    
    
      // add the instructions trials to the timeline
      timeline.push(instructionsTrial)
      

      // create the stimulus presentation trial structure
      var fixationCross = {
      	type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,
	    stimulus: '+',
	    choices: "NO_KEYS",
	    trial_duration: 500
	  }
	  var stimulusTrial = {
	    type: jsPsychImageKeyboardResponse,
	    stimulus: 'img-1.png',
	    choices: "NO_KEYS",
	    stimulus_width: 250,
	    trial_duration: 2500
	  }
	  var feedbackTrial = {
		type: jsPsychHtmlKeyboardResponse,
	    stimulus: 'The correct response to this stimulus is: h<br><hr>Please press h to proced.',
	    choices: ["h"],
      }

      // combine the three trial types into a single structure (trainingProcedure)
      var trainingProcedure = {
		timeline: [fixationCross, stimulusTrial, feedbackTrial],
		repetitions: 3
	  }

	  // and push the trainingProcedure into the main timeline
	  timeline.push(trainingProcedure)

      // run the experiment
      jsPsych.run(timeline);

    </script>
  </body>

</html>
```

**Checkpoint:** Paste the code above into your `experiment.html` file and then open the page. What do you see? Try changing some parameters and see what happens: change the image presented, change the number of repetitions, or change the correct response on the feedback trial for example.


## Conditional trials

Sometimes it can be useful to control whether a block of trials is part of the timeline or not dynamically. 

For example, suppose our experiment has two treatment conditions. Participants in the **Training** condition (`1`) complete the `trainingProcedure`, while participants in the **No Training** condition (`0`) do not complete the `trainingProcedure`.

JsPsych has a way to handle this kind of *Conditional* behavior, by adding a conditional function to the grouping object (sometimes called a `node` in the experiment or a `block` of trials). Here's how that could look when applied to the `trainingProcedure` block:

```js

// set the condition to No Feedback (= 0)
var participant_condition = 0

var trainingProcedure = {
	timeline: [fixationCross, stimulusTrial, feedbackTrial],
	repetitions: 3,
	conditional_function: function () {
		if (participant_condition == 1) {
			return true
		} else {
			return false
		}
	}
}
```

Notice how this works. The property `conditional_function` has a value that is a `function`. The function must return either `false` (skip this block in the timeline) or `true` (include this block in the timeline). The logic you encode in this function will determine when the block is presented versus skipped.

## Looping trials

Simlarly, jsPsych allows us to do something a little more dynamic than simply repeating a block, using a `loop_function`, which controls whether a block repeats on a loop. This could be useful in situations where you don't know ahead of time how many repeats of the trial block you need. 

For example, some studies include a comprehension check that participants must answer correctly in order to proceed. You could use a looping function to check whether the participant has answered correctly, and to repeat the trial block on a loop until some condition is met. 

The same logic could aslo be useful when you need participants to reach a certain level of accuracy in training before moving forward, for example. 

Here's how the `loop_function` could look when aplpied to the `trainingProcedure` block, in a hypothetical scenario where the participant must meet some training accuracy criterion before moving past the training block.

```js
var trainingCriterionMet = false

var trainingProcedure = {
  timeline: [fixationCross, stimulusTrial, feedbackTrial],
  loop_function: function () {
    if (trainingCriterionMet == 1) {
      return true
    } else {
      return false
    }
  }
}
```

Here we're just using the variable `trainingCriterionMet` to check whether the participant is ready to move on (`trainingCriterionMet = true`) or not (`trainingCriterionMet = false`), but later in the course we'll see how to consult the participant's data to make these kinds of decisions.

## Excersise

Create a multi-survey block of trials that is added to the end of your experiment and is only included for some participants.

For instance, create a block that combines the [survey-text](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/plugins/survey-text/) and [survey-likert](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/plugins/survey-likert/) plugins to assess participants' engagement with the experiment and collect any feedback they have. Use a `conditional_function` in the block to only show the survey block under some conditions.
