# 290Q Project Submission Guidelines 

Spring 2023 

[wdt@berkeley.edu](wdt@berkeley.edu)

**Deadline:** Friday ~~28th April~~ May 8th 2023 (deadline extended)

The goal of this assignment is to provide time and space for you to work on implementing an experiment of your choice. Submission will be via BCourses.

## Submission materials

* The code for your experiment (e.g. your html file and/or javascript code) and any associated media files (e.g. image files, audio files). 

* A brief (e.g. 500 words) project summary PDF describing your experiment and your experience attempting to implement it. Please summarize:
    * The goal of the experiment
    * Any stimuli that are part of the experiment
    * The procedure (what kind of trials participants will complete, how many, and in what order)
    * The data that would be collected 
    * Level of completeness (i.e. does the code run, or is it a partial implementation, or did you have any particular technical challenges)
    * Any extra information you would like to share about the implementation or functionality of the experiment

## Grading criteria

* Student progress will be assessed based on engagement with the assignment: a clear attempt to implement an experiment using jspsych (or alternative frameworks through agreement with the instructor). 
* Your experiment does not necessarily need to be complete, but it should evidence a clear attempt to implement your experiment. 
* Ideally the code you submit will be something I can open in a browser and run to assess, but if this is not the case, you can make up for this by describing any technical challenges you faced in your project summary document. 
* If your experiment involves many trials or large or numerous stimuli, you are welcome to submit an “illustrative” scaled-down version of the experiment that illustrates the core functionality.
