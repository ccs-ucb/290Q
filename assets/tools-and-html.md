# Lab 1: Developer Tools and HTML Basics

## Developer Tools

### Text Editor
You will need a text editor for writing and editing code. If you already have one you like, feel free to use that. Otherwise, I reccommend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Download one of these programs to your computer. Both should be free.

### Browser
You are free to use whatever browser you like best, but I reccommend using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for this course. If you don't already have it, you can download it for free.

## HTML Basics

Using your text editor, create an empty file on your computer called `experiment.html`. Paste this code chunk into the file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>290Q Experiment</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Open `experiment.html` using Google Chrome. You should see a blank page. Check that the title of the page (shown in the tab on Chrome) matches your title. Try changing the title in the code block above and reloading the page.
